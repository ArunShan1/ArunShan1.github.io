date: "October 14, 2018"

Religion is an important part of living here so I went to mass today

Morning/Afternoon
=========
The first half of the day was pretty average. Spent a lot of time catching up on the blog posts that I had missed over the last few days and then listening to this great 'East Africa Business Podcast' run by a guy called [Sam Floy](samfloy.com/podcast), a British guy who travels around East Africa interviewing businesses - there's loads of great content there if you're interested in the scene.

I also decided that I need to be a bit more active in recruiting trainers for my classes next week so I put together this abomination of a poster (don't blame me! First time!!)

I need to spend some more time tomorrow (15th October) recruiting some students for this but I think this is a good start.

Evening Church Visit
===================

Patrick and Honest, who I met at the conference last week, invited me to the [St Dominic Parish](https://www.facebook.com/St-Dominic-English-Catholic-Community-Kigali-112296148919141/) for church. They're actually in the [Good News Choir](https://www.facebook.com/GNChoir/), which is part of the university.

I usually like going to churches and other places of worship as it gives me an insight into the culture of the place. This church was purely in English which meant I was interpreting a lot more than others I had been to in Tanzania and Ghana. It was very peaceful and calm, a lot like the rest of the country and one thing that was noticeable was the long periods of silence for mediation/prayer. The pastor at the front was also very humorous and relatable - he made a lot of jokes, used stories about his personal life including admitting mistakes he had made.

It felt to me like quite a 'sophisticated' church in the sense that it was all in English and that people came from the upper middle classes. In addition, the message was more targeted at what to do with your wealth and how to not let it corrupt you. I think people really enjoyed being there and many people were regulars at this church.

Exploring Tourism
===================

I met up again with Jado (my biking tour guide) and also met his friend [Jean Luc](http://kigalitourism.com/kigali-by-car/), his business partner. We had some more chats about their business, how to get it registered (I was suprised to find that it wasn't given how easy it is to register here) and some steps to take on the marketing and finance side.

They were both really keen to take on ideas but I definitely felt a lack of 'critical engagement' in the sense that they weren't willing to doubt my ideas, which, for me, would make it hard to work with the them. Maybe it'll change as we get to know each other.

Jado told me about the many times he had gone out there to try to recruit customers and how he had faced rejection by customers, by restaurants, by hotels, by hostels etc. It seemed as if he was a bit dejected and didn't want to pursue those routes anymore because people thought he was too young. That repeated failure and persistence is such an important part of business. It reminds me of the endless days of selling chocolates I used to do as a kid. It's so hard to keep going but you just do it because you know that there's no other way and it really is inspiring when someone can do that.

We also briefly discussed the 'Smart Audio Tours' idea and they were excited by that too - I definitely think it's something I need to explore more.


Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: buhoro *(slowly)*

**Question**: Should we be two companies or one company together?

**Thought**: One thing I did that I'm really not proud of is that I got frustrated at the Moto driver for not getting me to the right place - he said he knew where the Burundi High Commission was but he took me to the Uganda one instead. I got a bit upset at him when I really should have kept my cool.

**Problem**: What's the next number in this sequence? 3, 8, 4, 6, 5, 8, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, ? - Hint: the even numbered positions represent letters.

**Business opportunity**: A crowd equity/debt-funding platform. People are trying to raise money, they borrow off their friends but their friends (who want to make some return) but there's nothing formal to encourage or systematise that.

**Takeaway**: This church was very different to others - I'd really like to visit some more to get a better understanding.
