I decided to jump in and understand what jobs in Rwanda were being advertised!

Jobs
====

So I got up really early in the morning (6am - sorry others in the hostel!) today and decided after talking to Baptiste that I would focus on jobs!

I found 5 specialised local job boards (Job Web Rwanda, East Af Market, Job in Rwanda, Mucurzi and New Times Jobs), 2 international boards (LinkedIn and GlassDoor) and 5 others that post the odd relevant job or loads of jobs that were no longer available.

I looked through about 150 different jobs from 50 different companies with a general goal of understanding the market. The spreadsheet with all the jobs on these boards is still a work in progress but isn't far from having everything out there.

A few key things of note:
- Quite a lot of these jobs are targeted at internationals and very specifically have requirements that no local could meet to satisfy visa requirements.
- It's very interesting which international companies are willing and keen to hire locals (hotels, universities) and those that don't care too much for creating local jobs (NGOs especially in health)
- A very significant number of the local jobs have high work experience requirements making it very unlikely they'll find anyone. These are ambitious hopes left out there for months or they're seeing who's willing to apply anyway.
- The companies that use these sites are mostly international companies. Either they're the only ones that have jobs or the rest just use connections.
- Uber is hiring for a country director! They're coming to Rwanda! (5 years of strategy/business is the experience required)
- Companies largely still have personalised application portals on their websites. The more startup ones have CV + Cover Letter but big companies have portals.
- They tend to only leave these jobs up for a week or two which is suggesting a good turnover
- There's no overwhelmingly dominant job board and there's less crossover on them than you might imagine.

After that, I had lunch with Baptiste, showed him some of my findings and we worked on an application to the Marriott for a bit.

He also introduced me to his friend Barnabas, who works as an advisory accountant for a number of companies. He's developed his own consultancy business and despite being fairly junior, has managed to make a name for himself. His next step is to sit the CPA and get more credibility. He seemed to have a fairly good business head on him and we discussed a fair bit about the emerging developments, financial markets in Rwanda, and the potential in the Tourism Tech industry.

Walking Money
=============

In the evening, I did some more reflection and thought more about how hard it is to get to know people here. One of the biggest challenges (it was the same in Tanzania but maybe I noticed it less) is the impression that people have of you that you're 'walking money'. It pops up in various ways from being clearly overcharged or scammed to people expecting you to pay and them intentionally meeting at nicer places.

Over time, you begin to doubt yourself and think that people only want to spend time with you for your money rather than for your ideas or personality and it's hard to overcome but it sort of comes with the territory. It's understandable why they would think that and when they're short on money, it's hard to act otherwise or point it out because you're worried about coming across badly. You want to start out on an equal footing and treat everyone as equals but it's hard to do that here.

One thing I've figured out from thinking about that is that when I do come back at some point, I'll really need to work with a partner who I'm already close and familiar with and might have to be relatively secure in their wealth just so that we can work together effectively and be on that equal footing with equal expectations.

It's either that or I have to be the person doing the financing and I'm less comfortable doing that initially. I want to be the person that works and pushes something forward. Good to think about all this and learn it all now :)



Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**:  kwiga *to learn*

**Question**: Do you have any photos of your place in London to show me? No. haha

**Thought**: I saw the missionaries again while I was riding a moto. Third time now. Such a small city!

**Problem**: Extend the ball problem (day 7) to twelve balls and assume you don't know if it's heavier or lighter. Can you figure out the odd ball out in 3 weighings?

**Business opportunity**: Technology in Tourism! Walking audio tours to learn about the city. Pay $10 for full city access. Whenever you're at an interesting area, you get a notification that there's a pre-recorded audio tour there!.

**Takeaway**: It's hard being seen as walking money but significantly harder finding a job in Kigali as a recent graduate.
