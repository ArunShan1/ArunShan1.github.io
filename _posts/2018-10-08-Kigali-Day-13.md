I arrived a the famous Kigali convention centre finally getting a chance to see it from the inside.

There was an inspiring opening ceremony with a really awesome song that was composed just for the conference.

I met loads of really interesting people including:

- [Sindi](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/200007), a visiting lecturer at the African Leadership Institute here but a permanent lecturer in SOAS and the University of Sussex. She's had experiences around the world and is really interested in diversity and innovative spaces.
- Patrick, a medical student at the University of Rwanda who had chosen to switch to do Medicine after a few weeks in Engineering. He wants to become a Neuroscientist.
- [Ashish Thakkar](http://venturesafrica.com/africas-youngest-billionaire-ashish-j-thakkar/), commonly known as Africa's youngest billionaire (in Rand). We had a brief chat about Data Centres and localising data storage in Africa.
- [Jackie Lumbasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Lumbasi), a Kenyan, that hosts Rwanda's first English Breakfast radio show. She became very successful in Uganda and we talked about passion vs professionalism and I've got an invite to visit her at the station!
- [Eleanor](https://gh.linkedin.com/in/eunice-eleanor-klinogo-0b4384162), a Commonwealth youth representative, from Ghana. We spoke about young people and how to get a seat at the table in decision making.

All round, I had an excellent day of meeting people. There were some interesting talks and speeches too but I generally find those harder to engage with than conversations os I tried to focus on that in general.

In the evening, I met up with [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nzaramba-samuel-a2607477), who works at Laterite (a research consultancy in Rwanda), but is also a learning community coordinator at [Andela](https://andela.com/). Andela has a really cool model, where they train up young African developers, and then get them overseas-based jobs inside Western companies. This gets cheaper labour for these companies and more opportunities for young African developers. They've just set up in Rwanda so I was keen to find out more from Sam. We also ended up discussing other ideas we had had, the talent in Rwanda especially in data science and opportunities for the future! All round, a great chat!

Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: urubyiruko *(Young People)*

**Question**: How does New Zealand fit into the picture? (The West, Africa, China etc)

**Thought**: One of the speakers mentioned that structure and preparation is not mutually exclusive to creativity and innovation. Yes, you need space to think and solve problems creatively but it's much better if you can have the structure to do that and everything else is in order.

**Problem**: You have a pile of 3,000 bananas. You wish to transport them to a place 1,000 miles away on the back of a camel; however, the camel can only carry a maximum of 1,000 bananas, and will eat one banana every mile it travels (and will not go anywhere if it does not have any bananas). However, you can load and unload as many bananas as you want anywhere. What is the most bananas you can bring over to your destination?

**Business opportunity**: Build an app that records loads of relevant details for entrepreneurs (work hours, finances, interactions etc). Get them to input it themselves with the incentive that those that have completed it will have a significantly higher chanced of getting investment because investors will know about their work and financial habits as well as their accountability.

**Takeaway**: Conferences are great for meeting new people!
