title: Kigali Day 20 - Getting energised!!!
date: "October 15, 2018"

Had a great day today - really getting into things here!

Olympiad Office
=======
Went to check out the classroom that I'll be using later in the week for the training of trainers and it's perfect. It's small, round-table so we can have more discussion, has a whiteboard and it's in an easily accessible area.

It's actually an office within the UNESCO office and I got to meet [Albert Mutesa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-mutesa-a2728a34), the secretary-general of UNESCO Rwanda as well as his admin assistant [Alphonsine Musabyimana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alphonsine-musabyimana-70638745). They were very helpful and happy to let us use the offices. They even mentioned that in the future, they could get funding to spread the program to train these teachers in maths competitions out of Kigali. It's great that they want to give teachers the capacity to not just help the struggling students but also allow the top ones to succeed.

I also reached out to Franca, who's going to send me the materials from the Maths Club Packages that AMI (African Mathematics Initiative) uses in other countries to integrate that into the training.

Then, other parts of the day were spent reaching out to people who had contacts that might be interested in the training - hopefully I can get the right people!


Tour with Patrick
================

So Patrick, my medicine friend, who wants to be a Neurosurgeon (his idol is Ben Carson) met me at his campus and gave me a bit of a tour of the University of Rwanda College of Medicine and Health Sciences. It's a really cool campus and seems a lot more developed and well-equipped than others I've seen like Ardhi and UDSM in Dar es Salaam.

We had a really nice lunch together afterwards at [Aromas Cafe](http://www.livinginkigali.com/reviews/kigali-cafes/aromas-coffee/) where we discussed loads of things. He's a really switched on guy and does really well in class - he wants to do his residency abroad and come back to improve Rwanda. We talked about one of his past businesses (exporting small packed dried fish from Burundi) to his new ideas (turning Avocados into oil, or developing a website to document African culture as part of UN Agenda 2063 Goal 16 of the 'African Cultural Renaissance').

He then got me to finally try out Kigali's 'tap and go' bus system, which is similar to the Oyster card. It's actually really easy and is way cheaper than the motos. yay for public transport!!

We also estimated some numbers for doing a small business here (e.g. a cafe). Around 200,000 RWF ($250 USD) to rent a place in a busy area like Remera and about the same again to pay for 2 employees. That probably covers the bulk of your monthly fixed costs and then if you can get people to be buying coffees/food for around 5000 RWF per person and the unit cost is 3000 RWF, then you only really need about 10 customers a day to be making profits. I guess this is why there are loads of fairly empty cafes.

He also really got me more into this 'Audio Tours' idea and said to told me 'You have to do it. By the time your trip is over, you have to have made some progress on it'. Jado and Jean Luc yesterday told me the same thing and Ange, the successful tourism entrepreneur said it would put her out of business, so I sort of felt like I had to at least explore the idea in more detail so do check out my other post!!!

Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: umuagani *(Story)*

**Question**: Are these chapatis as good as the ones you have in India? No way!

**Thought**: Mentioned to Patrick about what happens to Rwanda in the future without Kagame and he said that there was this same worry during a previous election but people really do believe that the succession plan is clear and that things will be stable.

**Problem**: A man has two empty jugs - 3 litres and 5 litres with no markings. How can he measure exactly 1 litre without wasting any.

**Business opportunity**: See the other post, or maybe an app for restaurants here to collect feedback on their servers. (I had a great one and they had a paper form but it was a bit of a hasssle)

**Takeaway**: Meeting people, sharing ideas, really getting deeper into things now! yay!
