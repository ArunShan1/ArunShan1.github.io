My hectic last couple of days...

So much happened these last couple of days and there was just constant jumping around from one meeting to another that it all just feels like a bit of a blur!

Awesomity
=========
Tuesday morning started with a trip to [Awesomity Labs](www.awesomity.rw). These guys are a group of software developers that are now famous in Rwanda for working with Volkswagen on a mobility project. I took to them to ask their thoughts on the idea and get a rough idea of how much it might cost to make this app. I knew I could potentially work on it myself in London or find some people to work on it with but I really do want it build here to grow the local economy.

Initially, they seemed really interested in the project and where very keen to work on it. They told me they have different models of work but generally, it's hard for them to fit into the model I was looking for (i.e. one where one of their team is a cofounder and works (at some point) full time on the project). They said they'd discuss and get back to me on Wednesday.

We met again on Wednesday and they had come up with a few models of working with different levels of technology and company ownership. We then moved on to discussing price (after my pushing) and I was quoted $80-100 USD per hour and it would take roughly 2 months to build an MVP so on the range of $50,000 for the initial MVP. This seemed absurd to me in terms of the cost per hour (on the scale of developers in the UK/US), length of time to build (I wouldn't expect more than 1 month) and the overall cost (I was clearly an entrepreneur trying to build something and create jobs rather than a rich idiot throwing cash at this).

I left feeling fairly disappointed and as if I was being taken advantage of. Obviously, I am also a bit worried that they'll take the idea and just run with it but they did seem like good guys (though it's easy to be foolish) and also they're focusing more, as a company, on building their consulting brand rather than building a product of their own. I also really don't mind if someone else just does this idea but I genuinely think they'll struggle to scale without me.


ALU Career Talk
===============

*ALU - logo, didn't take enough photos here*

I had a talk scheduled for some students at the African Leadership University on Wednesday evening. It turns out, that as a startup university, things had not gone too well organisationally. There was also another much larger talk scheduled at the same time that was compulsory for most students in the schools as well as another conference involving some visitors from the Mauritius campus. Everything was hectic and people were running around trying to get things going - just the type of environment I love!

In the end, we managed to get about 6 students that were particularly interested so we turned it into more of a group discussion because speaking to 6 people is a bit ridiculous. It was great for me because everyone introduced themselves, discussed their personal challenges and then we got to discuss some of the common themes. Here are some highlights:

1. No one knows what they're doing or what they will be doing. The students had vague ideas but were mostly discovering and I highlighted how important this process is. The US treasury department estimates that millennials will have an average of 25 jobs for 5 careers. It's very ok not to know.

2. Classic university and society tries to put you into boxes. 'Doctors', 'Engineers', 'Bankers', 'Consultants' etc. ALU seems to be unique in that it really tries to get people to think about trying to find a way to shape society rather than find a way to fit into existing society. My experience in UK has been pretty extreme in seeing people in the UK go into a very small range of careers and so it's great to see that people view this differently here.

3. When people say that you can 'change Africa', your Africa is defined by you. This was something that the students highlighted. There's so much pressure to do something huge but actually it starts with you, your life, your family, your friends, your company. You should find what impact you can have and the level that can keep motivating you.

4. You get told 'follow your passion' but you also need to do something that makes money, even more so in Africa. How do you find the balance? We talked about the difference between something you're good at (and therefore can make you money) and something you're excited about. We also talked about playing the long game and working on your passion so that you can turn it into a career in the future even if not immediately.

5. Networking. These students had the same constant nagging about networking as everyone else gets. We talked about what this means (talking to and listening to people you find interesting) and how this isn't limited to famous people or people further up the ladder than you.

Overall, it really was one of my favourite conversations I've had this whole trip. I really got an insight into the challenges the students are facing when it comes to career decisions. I'm really glad it was a small group since I really didn't want it to be just me talking at the front.


Olympiad Sustainability
=====================

There was also a fair bit of running around and meeting people to get the olympiad stuff going in the last couple of days. I met Emile one last time (gave him the set cards and he was really excited) and Dr Karangwa again (very keen to keep pushing things). I also popped into AIMS to drop off some UK Mathematics Trust and Art of Problem Solving books. I ran into Blaise, the AIMS director, again and he was really happy about the program. He was excited that it would engage his masters students and it could act as the outreach program in place of one that had previously been cancelled.

In the end because I had another meeting, Jessica, the Irish AIMS tutor, went out to the school, I had visited last week, on her own to talk about setting up the maths club and training the teachers. Apparently they were still very interested and keen to come to Kigali for those trainings (even the principal!).

The biggest success has been seeing Jessica take on the whole thing and ensure that at least some level of grassroots training actually happens. Who knows how the politics will play out but I'm fairly sure there will be a series of trainings over the holidays and there will be a lot of teachers who will know about and be enthusiastic for this to continue.

It's been really exciting playing the 'catalyst' role and I realise that it's actually something that I excel in. Just taking an idea, telling people about it and then bringing people together to make something happen. That side of things has been a huge huge success for me.

Patrick McSharry
================

I also finally managed to meet [Patrick McSharry](http://www.mcsharry.net/). He's someone I had reached out to very early on in my trip due to us having a lot of common interests (finance, data, emerging markets, tech.....sounds a lot like my intro on this blog). He's a professor at Carnegie Mellon University Africa and also the head of the African Centre for excellence in data science at the University of Rwanda. He's now mostly based in Mozambique though, which meant he was only here for the last couple of days of my trip. Luckily, after about 3 or 4 pestering emails, I managed to get an hour with him and we had some great discussions.

He gave me a great high level overview of what's happening in the data space and what he's involved in. He asked me loads about my roles at UBS and Citadel - he's done a lot of research in the quant space though mostly on an inter-day basis, including an interesting project on ranking companies from an environmental sustainability point-of-view (more complex than all oil companies are bad because some oil companies are actually investing into future solutions). We even discussed my Audio Tour idea and how he might be able to help kick it off through the Ageas trust (the organisation that runs the memorial) and get students to intern over the Summer. We even discussed the possibility of me doing a PhD in the future here at the Centre for excellence in data science.

It was all-round great conversation and we have loads in common so I'm really keen to continue the relationship with him, as someone who could even be a mentor in the future.


HearAfrica
===========

I really wanted to make some clear progress on the idea in the last few days since I was getting so excited about it so I'm really glad I did.

Sam, a former CMU student and current research associate at Laterite, who I had met a few weeks ago and discussed ideas with had introduced me to [Yvonne](https://ke.linkedin.com/in/yvonnewambui?trk=organization-update_share-update_update-text), a data scientist and co-founder of [HeptaAnalytics](https://www.heptanalytics.com/). Initially, we just shared some ideas. She's actually Kenyan but is committed to staying in Rwanda because of all the opportunities here. She had loads of opinions on which sectors are going to do well (i.e. fintech, agritech) and
how Rwanda will be cashless by 2020. I told her about the idea, she said it had potential though I should be careful about telling it to people and then said she'd introduce me to a software developer friend.

That same evening, I met up with [Romalice](http://romalice.strikingly.com/), director of software engineering at [Oltranz](https://www.oltranz.com/) - a financial payments company. We had some great discussions and really managed to click. There was lots of back and forth about ideas, business in Rwanda, the difference between Americans and Europeans. He was a real 'sales' guy with an open personality, a willingness to work with anyone and some level of charm. He was also quite keen on managing the development of software rather than actually building it himself. There was a sense that we really should work together on this idea so at the moment, I'm feeling like I'll at least give it a go.

I also met up with Ange, the women who runs Palm Breeze tours. We talked more about her business, how it works, what are the challenges, getting into the tourism industry and how to really win the market. She had lots of ideas on how to take it forward though technology definitely wasn't her forte. I think there's definitely room to work together on this as well though we'll see how things progress.


All round, it was an excellent worthwhile trip. I'll try to write a full review soon though it's better to do that when I'm back and I've had a chance to reflect.

Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: ngaho *(farewell)*

**Question**: So, when are you going to be back?

**Thought**: There's so much energy around Rwanda. So much desire to create and build a country, a continent. Yes, things do move slowly at times but at other times you'll see rapid change.

**Problem**: $n$ coins in a line, some heads, some tails. Each move involves removing a heads up coin and flipping neighbours (in the original line). Which property is necessary and sufficient for all coins to eventually be removed? What if we change the problem to count neighbours in the new line after each move?

**Business opportunity**: Not a business but an idea to tell people not just when you'll meet them but how long you're willing to wait until you have to leave. Could be easier if we all used calendar apps.

**Takeaway**: Being busy is so awesome and I'm really going to struggle to get back into London life after such an amazing time here.
