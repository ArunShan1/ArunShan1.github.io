Today was a day of getting to know people in the Maths World in Rwanda!

Breakfast Conversations
=======================

It started off with some random breakfast conversations at the hostel I'm staying in. 2 others were also going to this 'e-learning conference'.

[Zo](https://www.elearning-africa.com/ressources/profiles/profile.php?address_id=671300&lang=2) is a physics teacher in Madagascar, who has a book on changing the Madagascar physics for literature students curriculum, and other articles on pedagogy.

[Felix](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Felix_Bwire) is doing a PhD in information systems in Uganda with a focus on higher learning institutions.

We had some cool conversations on education in Africa, with particular emphasis on the lack of 'local context'. I.e how learning from curriculums and books that are imports from Western countries means that students don't relate to what they're learning.

I also met a lovely retired Brazilian woman, [Jo](https://www.facebook.com/MorandoOndeAMalaEsta/), who was previously a prison social-worker. She's now finished 35 years of caring deeply about the problems of others in unfortunate situations and is focusing on herself, travelling the world for almost 2 years now, having visited more countries than the average well-educated university student could name! You can check out her blog with all her travels in the link above.

Let the Maths Begin!
===================

After that, I began my journey to starting up a Rwandan Maths Olympiad Team by meeting up with [Dr Karangwa](https://twitter.com/karangwad?lang=en) - a now retired professor of Mathematics specialising in Celestial Mechanics at the University of Rwanda. He did his PhD in Finland and has been on the African Mathematics Union Committee. He was really excited about the idea and told me he had already been making plans to set up a Mathematics Olympiad Committee in Rwanda. We made some plans to set up the administrative infrastructure and arranged to meet the Rwandan Education Board together next week. He mentioned that one of the biggest challenges we're going to have is in funding, though $10,000 a year should be more than enough - which matches my estimates. (Nudge, nudge to people I'm going to be asking for a little help in the future!)

Next I went to visit AIMS Rwanda.

If you haven't heard about [AIMS](https://www.aims.ac.rw/) and you care about expanding the reach of mathematics - you absolutely should read about them. They have a belief that the next Einstein will be African and do some great work around the continent with centres in South Africa, Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania and now Rwanda. I also just found out that Rwanda has now become the location of the AIMS Headquarters, further validating my decision to pick Rwanda (Woo!). They have a group of masters students that they bring in from around the continent, lecturers from around the world who come in and teach short ~3 week courses as well as tutors who stay for the year to work with the students.

I had a meeting set up with [Blaise Tchapnda](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sophonie_Tchapnda), the academic director of AIMS Rwanda and a mathematician from Cameroon. During the meeting, he introduced me to [Franca Hoffmann](https://francahoffmann.wordpress.com/), a former Maths PhD at Cambridge (on the CCA program), doing a PostDoc at Caltech and also teaching the problem solving course at AIMS. She has been working on programs in African Mathematics (in Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia) since 2011 and was involved in setting up the Ghanaian IMO team. (Ideal person to meet!)

Her really useful advice was that I need Rwandans to make this work. They're going to be the ones driving this forward, organising the logistics and making my idea into a reality. I can definitely help in certain areas from abroad but they'll need to be doing the major work. She also mentioned that in Ghana, it started off really well but due to a lack of planning in funding, the only students that could go to the IMO were those whose parents could afford it. I really don't want this to happen here because that's really unfair and the well-off parents will have no incentive in the future to contribute/subsidise the success of other students.

This really fruitful conversation then led to dinner with some other AIMS tutors including [Eva Ujeneza](https://twitter.com/evauje?lang=en), a founding member of [RAWISE](https://www.rawise.org.rw/) (Rwandan Women in Science and Engineering), an organisation for Rwandan Women with a Masters or above in STEM fields. They're doing some really awesome work in supporting their members as well as other longer-term outreach projects but they do want to focus on opportunities that help students outside of Kigali. She was really excited by the idea and said she would discuss it with some other young Rwandans that might be interested.

In the evening, I had a really nice walk back home after an awesome day. Walked past the Kigali Convention Centre where the e-learning conference and many other international conferences are being held. Rwanda has turned itself into the go-to places for conferences in Africa and it's in large part due to the investment in this centre.


Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyurwanda Word**: Murakoze *(Thank you)*

**Question**: What are you doing here? Apparently walking where there isn't a footpath and on the grass isn't allowed and a man with a gun will make sure you know of it!

**Thought**: Data can help businesses both to provide better services to their clients but also in reducing risk, reducing unknown factors that can incentivise more risk-taking.

**Problem**: How far should you keep walking while looking for a motorbike taxi before you decide you're just going to commit and run the rest of the way. How does it change when it looks like Google Maps is wrong about the existence of certain roads?

**Business opportunity**: Providing change for Moto drivers for a fee. They never seem to have them and they don't even know where to look to get some.

**Takeaway**: Go into initial project conversations with an open mind. I met some people who know way more than me and incorporating their energy has been much easier with an open mind.
