title: Kigali Day 3 - ImpactHub, milk and missionaries!
date: "September 28, 2018"

Today was a random chaotic day of exploring Kigali!

Impact Hub
=========

I first went to see the [Impact Hub](https://kigali.impacthub.net/). They describe themselves as 'An innovation lab. A business Incubator. A social enterprise community centre.' It's a really cool space where a number of startups and larger social enterprises are based.

They also have a really cool event area on the top floor that just happened to be being used for the [Smart Kigali Challenge](http://www.ndangira.net/kigali-smart-cities-challenge-bootcamp/)

*Event for Poster*

I did meet a couple of participants of the event and they told me a bit about their project and the entrepreneurship space in Kigali ('so many opportunities') but they were just about to get into a full workshop session that was private but I hope I'll be able to see the results on Monday.

Milk
====

I never thought I'd be writing about milk but this was something to marvel at! I was just wandering round looking for a place to eat when I saw a little shop with buckets of spring rolls, samosas and chapatis. Inside was this huge Milk Tank and people were coming in to fill up petrol cans with milk. Then others would come in and stop by to get a quick glass of milk in. It was the busiest place around for miles. The food was just a side dish!

Missionaries
============

I randomly met some kids that looked like they had been skipping school but were actually Mormon missionaries half-way through their 2 year stint. We ended up chatting about life in Kigali, learning to become independent (they had only just finished high school when they began their journey) and even played a few games of [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)). And no, they didn't manage to convert me!

Rain
====

Out of nowhere, there was a huge rainstorm. In case you like the sound of intense rain, here's a glimpse:

At the end of a full-on day, I had dinner at a Ugandan restaurant with some AIMS people where they served 'Now Now Rolex'. No these aren't cheap knock-off watches, they're strange Chapati rolls with random fillings inside - the Italian one was particularly good.


Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyurwanda Word**: Mwiriwe Neza *(Good Evening)*

**Question**:

**Thought**: It's easier to meet a more diverse set of people when there is a large homogenous population and clear outsiders than when there's an inherently diverse population but everyone segregates into their groups of similar views (i.e. London)

**Problem**: In how many distinct ways can you create a dice with each face having a different number from 1 to 6 such that consecutive numbers share an edge. Dices obtained by rotating or reflecting other dices are considered the same.

**Business opportunity**: Flavoured Milk? Dairy-free versions of milk bars for the lactose-intolerant? Something milk-orientated...

**Takeaway**: You're not a tree, you're an animal with the innate ability to move and see other parts of the world so use it! - From [Jo](https://www.facebook.com/MorandoOndeAMalaEsta/)
