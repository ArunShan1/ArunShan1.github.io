3rd and last day of the conference!

Today was the last day of the conference. It was mostly a few final talks as well as some pitching. There were 4 main companies that pitched to a panel of 4 investors in what was called 'Face The Gorillas', similar to 'The Dragon's Den' or 'The Shark Tank'. The panel was a mix of CEOs of big companies as well as famous investors. I'll highlight the 4 companies here and how they did.

Tupuca
======

The first was [Tupuca](http://www.tupuca.com/en/) an Angolan company pitched by [Erickson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericksonmvezi/).

*Tupuca*

The company is an 'all-in-one delivery platform' that delivers a range of products including restaurant food, groceries, pharmaceuticals, electronics and a host of other products. Their tech is built by a South African company but their edge is in their logistics, having a network of drivers that they can manage efficiently. They already have 150 employees, revenue of $0.5 million and have a profit margin of $1.13 per delivery. They were attempting to raise a seed fund of USD 5 million.

There were a lot of tough questions especially on the financial side including why they need the money, exit strategy, whether this was the right platform to be raising so much and whether they were any different to Jumia, who wasn't making any money. They stressed that they were already profitable and that their unit economics were good but ultimately, the investors wanted to see more financial details before they were willing to invest.

To me, it felt like a solid business and they knew they wanted to be acquired by the likes of Delivery Hero in the future. They had a decent amount of financials to show but probably  not enough for their ask. They didn't even say how much equity they were giving or the potential ROI for investors. You'd need a lot more financial modelling but I think they did well to get their name and image out to a wider audience.

Emprego
======
The next was [Emprego](https://www.emprego.co.mz/), a job platform in Mozambique run by [Frederico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederico-p-silva-4b149737). It's the market leader in Mozambique and they were looking for USD 400k for 15% of the company. It also has operations in Greece and Angola.

Their focus was on how tailored their product was to the market in the sense that you needed very little data to use the platform, they had jobs targeted for locals and how simple to use it was compared to the international players (LinkedIn, Glassdoor etc). It was interesting to me since I had done a bit of research last week on the equivalent Rwandan market. They've also built a tailored SAAS (software as a service) tool for filtering candidates to help companies cope with the excess number of applications.

They did very well in pitching with a takeover offer by one of the investors (for 51% rather than 15%) first up since the investor was on the board of ITM Africa, the equivalent market leader in Angola looking to expand. This was a huge success and the entrepreneur was very open to the idea. There was a small question at the end regarding whether they were willing to be audited and he had a great response that they had been audited every year by Deloitte and were being audited by the revenue service this year.

Oriki
======
The next was [Oriki](https://www.orikigroup.com/), a Nigerian all-natural luxury skincare brand with existing distribution channels in Australia and the US as well. [Joyce](https://guardian.ng/business-services/entrepreneur/joycee-awosika-oriki-is-a-brand-for-people-to-use-and-identify-with-quality/) was looking for USD 250,000 for 10% of the company.

*Oriki - African Beauty Label*

The pitch was very solid and the ambitions were clear that they wanted to be an African competitor to the likes of L'Oreal. The fact that they had lots of potential distributors asking for products was great and made it clear that they really were in demand. The conclusion from the investors was that it was largely out of their market (In West Africa rather than East or South and in Beauty/Fashion) but they were all excited by the potential. They also mentioned that it was curious that she was asking for equity investment rather than a working capital loan that could help them fulfil the orders that they had.

Bag Innovation
=============
The last pitch of the day was by [BAG Innovation](https://www.baginnovation.rw/), a Rwandan company (though I later found out the MD is Swedish) that acts as a 'Youth Consultancy' working with companies to create case studies that help find and develop talent that are then placed into these companies. They were looking for $100,000 USD for 10% of the company.

*BAG Innovation - Rwandan Youth Consultancy*

I was very very impressed by the model. I've seen a lot of the challenges with talent in the region (largely in Dar es Salaam but now also a bit in Kigali too) and it seems that a lot of it does stem from a lack of practical experience doing the types of things that companies need you to do. By giving people case studies, you can definitely close this gap - the judges commented on this too and one of the judges had even used their services here.

The thing that I did notice during their presentation though was that their numbers really just didn't stack up. They said they had 2000 students in their network, 600 innovators (who had done case studies), 60 clients and 100 successful recruitments. This corresponded to 11.5 million Rwandan Francs (Rough $13,000 USD) meaning they got paid $130 USD per successful recruitment. Of this they said the profit margin was 46% so then roughly $60 USD per recruitment. This all sounds great from a margin point of view and if you say that there are even 1 million potential young people that they can get through this program, then you really do have a business. But at this stage, you can't value yourself at $1 million if you've only ever had $13k in revenue.

During the presentation I was trying to calculate how much I would value them at but I didn't get very far when the panel started speaking and one of the judges just outright made them an offer of $25k for 10% of the business valuing them at $250k. It did very much feel like a number pulled out of thin air or maybe a sort of 'speculative' investment to help the local ecosystem but does raise a lot of questions. It was very impressive that they managed to get this offer right off the bat and I caught up with the pitcher and COO, [Yussouf Ntwali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yussouf-ntwali-886636162) to get their details and maybe meet up afterwards.

Conference Conclusion
====================
All round, I had a terrific time at the conference and made sure to get contact details of the people I connected with in case I were to go to countries like Kenya, Uganda, Congo, Chad, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea etc.  The biggest takeaway for me was still the energy and the connections. It's hard to learn a lot in these settings as most things I learn either practically or online rather than from someone speaking to a big group but I still took a lot away.

AIMS
======
In the evening, I met up with [Dr Herine Menya](https://alinstitute.org/17-about-fellows/138-herine-otieno-menya-2) (recently got her PhD), who's running the AIMS clinic on Saturday for students struggling with some areas of mathematics. She had asked me to volunteer some of my time and I was more than happy to. She ended up giving me hundreds of questions that teachers had hand-written and sent photos of to type up. So that's what I've been tasked with doing for the next couple of days. My live latexing skills from way back in Canada are now somehow going to find a way to be useful!




Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: kwandika *(To write)*

**Question**: So are you going back to the UK after the conference? Not yet!!

**Thought**: These are definitely the best pitches/presentations I've seen in a while. They were quite impressive. One thing I did notice was that people were very happy to be 'bought out' - their strategy was to be taken over. They're almost waiting for global players to enter the market and dominate but are preparing to be the top when that happens.

**Problem**: A total of $2010$ coins are distributed in $5$ boxes. At the beginning the quantities of coins in the boxes are consecutive natural numbers. Martha should choose and take one of the boxes, but before that she can do the following transformation finitely many times: from a box with at least 4 coins she can transfer one coin to each of the other boxes. What is the maximum number of coins that Martha can take away?

**Business opportunity**: I had dinner with the guy who owns the hostel and he's very convinced that there is a market for 'mid-range' food - very similar to the Tanzania idea of creating a food delivery for office workers.

**Takeaway**: I really enjoyed hearing about businesses on the other end of the spectrum, the ones that were closing to making it but there's a lot to learn from their challenges too.
