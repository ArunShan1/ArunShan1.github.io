Today was a fairly relaxed chilled out day.

In the morning, I had breakfast with a monkey:

Then I went to the Kigali Public Library and chilled out for a bit longer. I met a Japanese woman who's working at the [Clinton Health Access Initiative](https://clintonhealthaccess.org/) on a Malaria project across East and Central Africa for 6 months. I was very impressed that she had just moved out without having even been to Africa before. I guess I did the same when I went to University.

Here are some other random photos in Kigali that I took.

In the evening, I met [Davy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davy-uwizera-601b5982/), head of data analytics at a Kenyan mobile payment company. He leads a team of 6 based in Rwanda (only their data team is in Rwanda) and he had a lot of interesting thoughts on the potential for data in Rwanda. He's really excited for the Open Data Revolution and says that it is possible to get data from these companies.

In the evening I watched a movie called Three Identical Strangers and generally had a really relaxed day.


Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: Murabeho *(Good bye)*

**Thought**: It's interesting that Rwanda is attracting institutions that are looking for talent (AIMS, Andela, ALU, Carnegie Melon etc) - people are seeing its potential.

**Problem**: Make a 3x3 'magic square' (all rows, columns and diagonals have the same sum) with the numbers 0-10 excluding 1 and 9.

**Business opportunity**: Some sort of fast food (or at least ready to go) - it's really hard to get instant food here.

**Takeaway**: It's good to have a relaxed day once in a while
