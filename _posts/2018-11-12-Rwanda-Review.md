title: Review of my time in Rwanda

My key takeaways 2 weeks after getting back from Rwanda - the things I hope I'll remember about my first time:

1. The place is super awesome. It has my sort of vibe - opportune, optimistic, trying to find itself.

2. The maths was great - I love problem solving and I love sharing in the process with others.

3. I struggled being alone so much but I did enjoy it when I forced myself to connect with people. Those connections are really hard to build, especially over such a short period of time.

4. The most valuable thing about a job for me is the routine it gives you - without it, it's easy to drift. I spent days not doing that much - sometimes I would do things just so I would have something to write on the blog.

5. The genocide really does impact a lot of life there even though it isn't spoken about. As unbelievably tragic as it was, there is a value in a shared understanding of the past when it's used in a positive way as it's being done in Rwanda.

6. It's easy to start 'coasting' - assuming you understand things because you've seen it before. It takes a lot of effort to keep challenging things and questioning them. I didn't do it that well but it was only when I did that I felt I took more out of the experience.
