title: Kigali Day 5 - Being a Tourist/Expat
date: "September 30, 2018"

Because it's a Sunday and not much was happening, I decided to do some tourist and expat things.

Climbing Mount Kigali
=========

I haven't done much exercise in a while and I wanted a good view of Kigali as a whole so I decided to go up and climb Mt Kigali. It's definitely more of a hill but a nice walk nevertheless.

*The Walk Up*

I was sort of wandering rather than following a clear route up so I ended up stumbling upon a random electric facility??? (Do correct me if it's something else!) as well as a military base where I was shooed off and told to go in any direction but that one!

I ended up finally finding the place and settled into a nice cool smoothie atop the mountain at this touristy cafe.

I was up there for a while chatting to some expats who have lived here for a couple of months. They were excited to tell me all the nicest places to go and their evaluation of the place so far. 3 of them were working on building a cancer research facility at a hospital (they admitted it might not be the highest priority project, but that's what they had been asked to come and help with) and the 4th was working at the UN in the communications department. It was interesting to hear their perspectives on the city, working with Rwandans and how to make the most out of my time here.

We came down and got some more cool views.

When we got to the bottom, we went to this restaurant called 'Sundowner', where they do classical Rwandan food. One of the specialties here is a brochette, essentially meat on a stick. The standard is beef but there's often chicken, fish and here there was goat so I tried out some goat ones (yes, I'm being even more loose on my vegetarianism here out of necessity).

Again, I chatted some more to the expats, learning about expat life here. The whole group was very international and had a range of experiences that they were coming at these projects from. The guy from China had actually been part of the original Tianamen square protests though he says he left a week in before it went crazy because he thought the students would win!

Shopping Mall
=============

In the evening, I needed some cash so I went to Kigali Heights, the central shopping area that's right next to the convention centre. There weren't a huge number of shops there but it was what you'd expect - loads of nicer restaurants, banks, a supermarket, and even a cool little book store!

The supermarket had everything I could possibly want as an expat here. It was all very much overpriced as you might imagine, especially the imported products like nutella for £8

Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: Mzungu *(White person)*

**Question**: What jobs can expats have here that really do have impact?

**Thought**: One of the coolest ideas I saw today were traffic lights that were continuously showing how long there was left till the next red/green. This was for both cars and pedestrians.

**Problem**: Use 6,3 and 5 to make 57. You can use +,-,x,/,!,^ and square root.

**Business opportunity**: Something at the shopping mall that's fairly cheap that could serve the younger Rwandan population - they like being at the mall because it looks cool but a lot of things are too expensive. E.g. a cinema?

**Takeaway**: The expat/international community here are very welcoming, if I ever were to consider living here.
