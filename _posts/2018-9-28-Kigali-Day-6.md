Today was the first day I felt like I wasn't on holiday in a while!

Meeting at the Education Board
==============================

I had a meeting with [Dr Karangwa](https://twitter.com/karangwad?lang=en) as well as [Mr Emile Kuriza](https://twitter.com/mukiza78emile), the head of the mathematics curriculum at the [Rwandan Education Board](http://www.reb.rw/index.php?id=6)(REB). The REB are the ones that run education at the primary and secondary level.

He told us that, since 2011, they have had a [national sciences competition](http://education.rw/rsc/) that runs across over 70 schools in the country. The first part consists of a written 2-3 hour exams in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. The second part is a group 'science fair', involving a period of discussion, presentation and questions for students on a particular topic.

We discussed more about the potential for putting together an IMO team and he was quite excited about the prospect. He wanted me to put together a proposal so I spent the rest of the day going to nice places, eating nice food and doing work!!

I had a fish brochette for lunch with fried bananas at the [Hotel Chez Lando](https://www.hotelchezlando.com/) on the recommendation of Dr Karangwa. Met a really friendly waiter there too who I'm going to hang out with tomorrow.

I thought I'd go looking for the University of Rwanda College of Business and Economics but ended up getting lost on the way and this man (below) kept telling me to follow him in Kinyurwanda (I think???) and led me down a random track.

Eventually, I gave up and just went back to the Kigali Public Library where the waiters know I'm a regular now and come and chat for a while, which is nice. Dinner was some yummy quesadillas!

Really glad the proposal and some of the ideas on it are now coming together. Let me know if you want to take a look! Would be happy to get some feedback.

Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyurwanda Word**:  Akazi *(Work)*

**Question**: My dream is to live in London. Why would you be in Kigali when you could be in London?

**Thought**: It's really cool how some of the rawness of the city still exists with the random shortcuts down hills and paths that have been carved out of convenience without too much thought. I imagine that these aren't very helpful in the rainy season when it gets muddy but we'll see I guess since that should be soon.

**Problem**: Find all sets of 3 numbers such that the sum of the 3 numbers is the same as the lowest common multiple.

**Business opportunity**: An interface over Google Maps so that when you search for a destination, you not only get the exact location but the 'well-known' landmarks near it and the corresponding route relative to the destinations so that you can easily explain a new location to your driver. This would then get you lots of data on where and how tourists are going. Maybe if you're cycling or walking in London, it can tell you the key locations to look out for every x minutes. Then you don't have to stare at your phone the whole time and you can get to know the city better.

**Takeaway**: Yay, I do actually like working when I really care about the result!
