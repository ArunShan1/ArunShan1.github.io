I had a really intense day of emotions visiting the genocide memorial.

I have no photos or experiences to share with you today. I think it's more important that you spend that time reading and learning a bit about the genocide. I would recommend coming to Rwanda and seeing the memorial for yourself once, but at least check out one of the resources below.
