title: Kigali Day 21-24 - Math Olympiad Traction!
date: "October 19, 2018"
---

Had an awesome few days making progress on the Olympiad team!

Coffee with Herine
==================

I finally managed to get a 1-1 with Herine, the head of the AIMS Teacher Training Program here in Rwanda. It turns out that setting up the olympiad is one of the things on the AIMS TTP mandate so they're very happy to continue the work that I've been putting in this week. It was really great to chat to her and you could see her enthusiasm for maths, education, teaching, girls' education and reaching all children come through.

One thing that I did struggle with was the 'charity approach' - as an example, she wanted to do a fundraiser to buy lamps for kids and she was really praising the UK 'charity shop' model. The interesting take that she did have on it though was that the main goal was actually in the conversation that it started. Most people don't know that there are lots of students that want to study but just don't have the light to do it in the evening (it gets dark quite early here year-round and students have to do chores when they get home). I think there's something there about finding a way for people to engage in a way that's perceived to be impactful in order to facilitate more tangible impact.


Dinner with Olivier
===================

In the evening I had dinner with [Olivier Ishimwe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-ishimwe-aa94bab8), a software developer who studied in China. He told me a little bit about his business [Hviewtech](www.hviewtech.com/), his software development business and some of their products. The one he talked about the most is 'Wawupay', essentially the WePay for Rwanda/Africa that integrates payment services for all businesses. He had some interesting thoughts about the parallels between China and Rwanda in doing business. He's moving to the US to do his Masters, which surprised me because he's got a business here with a decent amount of (low-interest loan) funding. He was also really excited about taking me to visit his school in the South of Rwanda.

Byimana school
==============
Olivier mentioned that his secondary school is the best maths/science school in the country and it's the school that the government allocates the best students. They top the charts every year in Science (except for a couple of small private schools) and he said that would be the perfect place to start the olympiad infrastructure.

It involved a hectic 1 hour bus to Muhanga and a moto ride where the motorbikes were going at 90km/h. We got there and we got lots of energy from the teachers and the headmaster in terms of the possibility of setting up Maths clubs and challenging the top students.

African Leadership University
============================
Sindi invited me to come visit the [African Leadership University](https://www.alueducation.com/), which focuses on educating Africa's future leaders. They have a few different degree programs including the MBA and undergraduate degrees in Computer Science, Entrepreneurship and 'Global Challenges'. Their campus is above Kigali Heights (the main shopping centre) and the place is really modern - it reminds me of the Facebook office, with booths, open co-working areas, bean bags and just a lot of well thought-out learning spaces.

It's also very new - being in just their second year of existence and so they're adapting with everything they do from curriculum to teaching styles to lecturers (some as young as 25!). They realise they need a different approach than traditional education and they're treating it as a startup that has rapid iteration cycles, which is a great approach.

I spoke with [Gaidi Faraj](https://www.alueducation.com/about/faculty-and-academic-leadership/
), who's the Dean of Faculty there. He gave me a tour of the location and then answered some of my quite intense questions about the challenges. For example, there are major funding challenges with most students on some sort of scholarship/work-to-study program while a few can pay on their own. They also have a big challenge in the Mauritius campus with the locals of Indian origin not identifying as 'African' and therefore not wanting to go the African Leadership University as well as in getting accreditation across the continent (Rwanda was by far the easiest).

He was also really interested in my background (partly because he had spent a long time in Tanzania) but also in how I could help his students. I ended up agreeing to helping out some students who were studying for their first actuarial exam the next day, hosting a revision class. I've also agreed to give a talk on 'kickstarting your career' next week with a focus on mathematics. I don't know how much value I have to add but I guess I'm a few years ahead of the students and it's always good to see what options are out there. I'm really excited to be giving that talk!

Maths olympiad
==============

The major thing has been the olympiad, which has taken off really well. I've already had 2 training sessions with teachers/AIMS students and there'll be more on Saturday and Sunday. The first one was largely an introduction into olympiads, what they are and how they work while the second was a full example session with 6 problems and a couple of us trainers walking around giving the session.

The sessions so far have been an overwhelming success with everyone coming despite a lack of transport costs being paid and food & water at the event. We've had no incentive except the desire to learn and pass on the knowledge. We had about 12 teachers the first day and 15 AIMS students and almost all of them came the second day. People have even invited their friends to come. There's so much enthusiasm to make this happen at the grassroots level - hopefully the administration can sort things out and do their part!

Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: ikibazo *(question)*

**Question**: You're the teacher and we're the student here but do you know the answer?

**Thought**: I'm really proud of the patience I've had with this project. I didn't jump into things too quickly and even if I had pushed harder earlier, I would have run into administrative issues. This time, there hasn't been any because we've used all the official channels. Slow and proper has paid off :)

**Problem**:There are 4 treasure chests (A,B,C,D) each with a message written on it. Only one of the messages is true. Only one of the chests contains treasure. A says 'The treasure is in this chest'. B says 'The treasure is in A or D'. C says 'The treasure is not in this chest'. D says 'The treasures is in this chest'. Which chest contains the treasure?

**Business opportunity**: Still thinking more about this Audio Tour - The name I've been thinking about is 'HearAfrica' or 'HearRwanda', where the focus is on hearing and understanding the perspectives of locals.

**Takeaway**: Absolutely loving getting into the olympiad. It's really got me excited.
