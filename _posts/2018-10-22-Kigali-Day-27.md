A day of dealing with stakeholders to ensure my work continues!

Politics
========

So I've had to deal with a few different interest groups in trying to get this going and it's been a good lesson in understanding various interests and trying to bring people together. I'll try and clarify the 3 groups and their interests. (My interest was largely in just getting this thing up and running and having as much training and problem solving as possible).

1. REB - The Rwandan Education Board. This is the government ministry in charge of the secondary education system including the teachers and any events involving the students. They want everything to go via them and to clearly show the government's progress. Emile, the Maths and Sciences curriculum head, is really friendly and clearly wants to continue this but he wants an 'organisation' to clearly own this. The plan was initially for the Mathematical Society of Rwanda to own this but it'll take a while before it's set up.

2. AIMS Teacher Training Program - This is part of the larger AIMS Next Einstein Forum and is sponsored by the MasterCard Foundation. They're focused on a few specific regions in Rwanda especially outside of Kigali. It was in their mandate to run and pass on the olympiad so they have a clear interest in owning the project. They're also massively understaffed so they struggle to actually do any of the work. Herine is very clear and strong-willed about her opinions. She has spent a lot of time working on these sort of projects and knows how to make things happen.

3. AIMS Rwanda - This is the local version of AIMS that mainly focuses on teaching Masters students. They want to support the olympiad as part of their outreach program for 2018. They have a lot of resources in terms of space to host trainings and masters students who can volunteer in training students but lack a clear mandate or relationship with the government to work on this project. Jessica, one of the tutors who was previously on the Irish team, is leading the charge from this angle and very clearly wants this to be an AIMS Rwanda outreach program.

In addition to these players, there's also a few professors who are setting up the 'Mathematical Society of Rwanda', who do want to own the project (preferably now rather than have it handed over later), UNESCO (who so far have just volunteered to help but haven't shown clear interest in owning the project) and RAWISE (the women's STEM network where Eva, one of the cofounders, wants a high degree of quality in anything that's created and worries about the influence of professors).

So generally, a lot of players and a lot of careful negotiation over the day trying to get people on board and understand how things will play out. You can see some of the tensions in the TV show below about the quality of teachers in Rwanda. (Feel free to speed up and skip to the middle). Some comments were noted on the inappropriate levels of criticism of the government as well....

Sales
=====

In the evening, I learnt a few things about Sales and some other challenges in Rwanda from a surprising source - some Korean missionaries.

I had met them at the end of last week at a cafe - one of them had come up and asked if I was a developer and that led to some interesting conversations so I agreed to go to dinner with them at [The Hut](www.livinginkigali.com/reviews/kigali-restaurants/the-hut/). They did mention at the time they were missionaries and that they had been here for a year with some difficulties with locals here so I was curious to find out more. Initially the conversation started out fairly tame with them just asking a lot of questions about my work (a fair bit of translation was needed). They were all quite interested in the Maths - I gave them some example questions and one of the guys was particularly excited.

After a while, they started getting into full preaching mode. There was a period of probably about 20 minutes when one guy was speaking in Korean, the other was translating and I was listening. Some of it was fairly standard stuff that I had heard before but there were some interesting bits about how missionaries had worked in Korea and some of their challenges here in Rwanda. They had initially thought they had found 'their person' - the guy who could lead and build the system here and apparently they had worked with him for a while but apparently the guy turned on them after a while. It also seemed that they really had committed fully to this - they were planning to stay in Africa for the rest of their lives. They had felt that this was their calling leaving fairly good opportunities behind.

They drew quite a lot of parallels between the work I was doing and what they were doing, which I thought were at time stretched but fairly interesting. I did appreciate that they were fairly open-minded taking on board my perspective about appreciating religions of all kinds and the importance of the underlying values more than the practices or narrow beliefs about the after-life. I learnt about the value of being clear and committed in your pitch, adjusting at times to reflect the person you're talking to, but then being clear about your purpose for talking to them. It reminded me a lot of the 'little history of religion' book I had read earlier and how religions are the most successful ideologies of all time transcending nations, cultures, time and huge radical changes.

We also talked about some of the challenges of talking to Rwandans who had had such bad experiences of churches here during the genocide (some of them were the main culprits in killings) and why so many had converted to Islam afterwards. We talked about the extent to which people were 'true' Christians - I always find the notion of claiming someone else isn't a true Christian a bit hard to swallow because it places some judgement of rightness and wrongness and supposedly in Christianity, only God can really do that. There was also some non-serious discussion about sports, life in Rwanda and food as well which made it not too intense.

Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: idini *(religion)*

**Question**: Do you not know or are you just not admitting the truth?

**Thought**: I think I have had a good balance here getting the chance to converse and understand locals but also meeting a lot of people coming in and out of the country. I think it's important, for me at least, to have both.

**Problem**: A set of 3 positive integer \{ a,b,c \} is considered special if a is a factor of b+c, b is a factor of a+c and c is a factor of a+b. Find all special sets.

**Business opportunity**: Getting 'filtered water' e.g. through the [LifeStraws](https://www.lifestraw.com/) into restaurants to replace the usual request for tap water. (Water is more expensive than basically any drink except maybe coffee). We have one in the hostel that's great but it would be helpful if they were everywhere.

**Takeaway**: There's so much to learn out here from meeting people, working on projects and just generally being in a place full of opportunity.
