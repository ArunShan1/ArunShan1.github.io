title: Kigali Day 16-18 - AIMS Clinic
date: "October 13, 2018"
---

Condensed 3 days of working on the AIMS clinic into one post.


Maths Questions
==============
The first couple of days included a lot of typing maths questions into LaTeX. This was great fun as it gave me a bit of an insight into the maths curriculum here for Senior 1 (equivalent to Form 1 or Year 7) but it really was a lot of work to do!

Food
====

I went to a few nice places for food and hung out with some of the other hostel guests. There's a really nice (but London-priced) restaurant called Repub Lounge that does a great stewed fish. Java House up on Kigali Heights (the shopping complex next to the convention centre) also does a great chai latte. Inema Arts Centre is really cool and does a big Thursday meet-up for the expats where I saw some familiar faces.

ATM issues
==========

I got into a bit of a pickle on Friday morning with the ATM eating up my card. I immediately went online to the Halifax App and cancelled my card thinking it was some sort of fraud. There was someone else in the queue waiting for me and he told me that it was an ATM for police and army only so that's why my card didn't work but I can go back to the bank with him to get someone to get me a new card. Luckily it worked out and I got my card back with no issues but when I called up Halifax, they said there was no way I could reactivate it.... too bad it's not the same as Monzo where freeze and unfreeze are on the app...

Dinner Invite
==============

On Friday evening, I went to visit Sindi (who I met at the conference) and her 14-year old son, Matisse for dinner. They were really welcoming and we had loads of really interesting discussions. They had lived all over the world and had very similar views to me about the challenges of London and the brushing aside of race issues. They had some really interesting stories about living in South Africa (including a friend who was murdered for asking for more sugar in their tea??). The dinner was really nice and cooked by their house-help, Sylvester - they're still struggling to get used to having house help. Matisse was an incredibly curious kid and wanted to know all about Mathematics, Banking, New Zealand, everything.


Maths Clinic
======

Saturday was all about the clinic. I have loads of photos so I'll spam them here (none of them me). It was out in a place called Kayumbu in the Southern province at the Ecole Seconaire Rutobwe. It was fairly rural and we left the main road and spent about half an hour on a rocky hilly road where at times it felt like the bus might not be able to make it.

Reflections
==========

- There were a lot of similarities between this and the Think Big Challenge that I had organised with CDI and BFC in Tanzania. Lots of kids, lots of energy, important guests, little food, everything running late, people madly running around, everyone waiting for the next event etc

- There were some key differences that made this better - the involvement of parents ensured that something was taken away and that there would be more continuity, the active role that teachers played meant they had an incentive to keep the energy going in the classroom once the program was over and finally that it was about something concrete and measureable (maths improvement and continued engagement in mathematics).

- I learnt about the maths systems in some other countries talking to the students. I learnt that in Cameroon, they're worked incredibly hard and expected to learn and memorise a lot. And also, that they're often taught in both the French and English system meaning they have a really good grasp of both. A student form the Ghambia told me that as far as he knows, only 1 student from the Ghambia has ever gone to Oxford and he's just the 6th AIMS student from the Ghambia.

- There was a huge variety of students. Some of them really 'got it' and could do almost all of the questions in no time. But a lot of them just didn't understand what was even going on and mostly ended up copying their friends. It seems like they needed a lot of 1-on-1 time. I can definitely see the potential for good students to do well though.

- The teachers were all really engaged. I guess these were the ones who were volunteering a weekend for the program so it was somewhat unsurprising but it was cool to see. Some of them had or were planning to work towards their masters degrees and had views on the challenges of the curriculum including one major problem of adapting the 'methodology' (more interactive, hands-on etc) without changing the content, providing training or materials for the new methodology.

- The host school had on average most of the really good students. It seemed like they were much more keen on this sort of stuff and were very willing to co-operate and make it happen.

- Life as a teacher (marking, teaching, managing students etc) requires a lot of work and I developed more respect for them after this.

Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: umubare *(Number)*

**Question**: What is a function? (Teacher spent a good amount of time trying to explain this)

**Thought**: The bus was really late which put everything behind schedule. They had done a really good job organising everything else but this sort of lost the first 2 hours of the day, which made it really hard to catch up.

**Problem**: What am I?
I am owned by one but used by many
I can do some things much faster than any human being
But you may also look through me and see
A special world of beauty

**Business opportunity**: Nothing these last 3 days. Been in too much of a charity mindset unfortunately.

**Takeaway**: Really enjoyed the clinic, helping out and meeting some really interesting people - it was a good way to continue after the conference!
