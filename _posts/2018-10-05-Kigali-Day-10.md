I decided to take one of the bike tours and had an adventure!

Mountain biking
==============

So [Rwanda Adventures](http://www.rwandan-adventures.com/bikinginrwanda.html) does some really cool bike tours around the country and I haven't really left Kigali so I decided I would try one of them. I took the Kigali Hills and Views tour (it was $90 which is on the pricey side but well worth it for the experience).

They arrived to my hotel in the morning with some awesome looking mountain bikes.

I was introduced to [Jado](kigalitourism.com/kigali-on-foot/), my guide on the bike and then we got going. Initially, we were just getting out of Kigali and it was quite hectic. The main road near where I'm staying is nicknamed the 'Stone Road' which means it's laid out as stones and so going down at the beginning was already quite bumpy.

We then got to the first off-road section in Nyamirambo. There was a huge truck in the way and so we had to carry our bikes around avoiding the muddy bit. I slipped, and got my foot covered in mud but managed to recover. During the slip, I had actually dropped my phone without noticing but the construction workers there very kindly called me and gave me my phone - another testament to the kindness and safety in Rwanda.

We headed southwards via Rwanda's largest prison (where they keep many of the genocidaires) and saw some of the prisoners doing community service and were actually quite friendly.

I got a glimpse into the Rwandan country side. There were loads and loads of small farming plots that people were tending to - cabbage, sweet potato, spinach, tomatoes, cassava. I really do believe the 'Land of a thousand hills' nickname though a thousand might be an underestimation and Jado told me that now they're extending it to 'Land of a thousand hills and a million banana trees'!

We then kept going along the Congo-Nile river and followed it down for a while. There were so many young children (apparently it was a school holiday for kids to have injections) and they had all been taught to say 'Good Morning' and 'How are you?' which was really cute. All the farmers were really friendly allowing us to go through their plots and showing us the way and the kids just wanted to follow our bikes for as long as they could and then stay with us for lunch.

Adventure on the way back
========================


The way back was super intense. It wasn't mountain biking any more but a tarmac road that had a slight gradient but went on and on forever (10km or so) and it felt like we were making absolutely no progress. Every time, we'd get to the top of one section thinking it was the top, there would come another bit. It was gruelling work but I really enjoyed the challenge. We also noticed that huge rain clouds were following us and we really wanted to make it back before we were soaked so there was a bit of cat and mouse as we would get hit by a few rain drops but then keep going. It was a bit of an adventure and we kept having to decide whether we should stop and seek cover or keep going.

Eventually, we made it to the top of this mountain and then suddenly the rain caught us but then we only had a slippery downhill to navigate. The rain turned heavy just as we reached our destination and we cried out to the people inside to let us in as we were being soaked. It was a perfect finish to an awesome day though - a full on shower to cool down and the general hilarity of making it to the top just in time.

Jado was such an amazing guide who told me so much about the country and I had an awesome time - I would fully recommend!


Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: Nyamirambo *(Place where bodies are buried)* - (note this if from centuries ago when the Burundians invaded)

**Question**: Can you get to New Zealand from London by train?

**Thought**: People in the countryside are unbelievable friendly. I probably interacted with over 200 kids, farmers, transporters, grocery sellers etc and so many of them had a few practiced English sayings, responded to my poor Kinyarwanda (and sometimes Swahili!.

**Problem**: The mountain range problem. A mountain range is projected on to the cartesian grid where the start is at (0,0) and the end is at (10,0). The range never goes below 0. This corresponds to a function from [0,10] to the positive reals. One hiker starts at (0,0) and the other at (10,0). They must reach the opposite end but must always be at the same height at every moment. Is it possible for every mountain range?

**Business opportunity**: I found out that Jado has a tour company of his own so I'm going to have a chat to him to understand his business more since I imagine finding customers as a local is much harder without understanding the market. Would be great to support local businesses.

**Takeaway**: I love outdoor activities but I definitely need to be fitter if I want to do them more!
