title: Kigali Day 4 - Quiet, then bustle on 'Umuganda'
date: "September 28, 2018"
---

Today is Umuganda, the monthly community service day that all Rwandans must participate in.

Umuganda
=========

I woke up fairly late but I managed to get a glimpse of what I think is a pretty cool concept. Essentially, there are big organised groups within each province, district and sub-area within Kigali and they have an organised day (or in the case of Kigali, morning) of community service. This involves some sort of physical labour e.g. cleaning or building.

The roads were absolutely empty and everything was quiet.

I walked aimlessly for a while until one of the cops, ensuring all Rwandans were working, pointed us to a group. It seemed as if every motorbike in the city was here. There were definitely none available to take you anywhere!

It seemed that they had just finished cleaning and there was a presentation ceremony where everyone was listening intently and people were proud of their public service. To me, it felt like this sense of national civic duty that Umuganda gave to people, made people much more proud of ensuring there was no crime. In particular for the motos, I would hypothesis that this is why they're really trustworthy and women have no problem walking around at night and using them.

While I was walking around discovering all of this, I was chatting more to [Zo](https://www.elearning-africa.com/ressources/profiles/profile.php?address_id=671300&lang=2) who was telling me more about Madagascar, the political challenges there and the hopelessness that he feels. He has a sense that no matter how hard one works there, there's nothing they can do. It was really sad to hear. We shared more ideas and plans though - he was particularly excited by the maths olympiad idea and even more so when he found out there's a physics olympiad.

Bustle in the city centre
=========================

After Umuganda was over and I could finally find somewhere to get some food, I decided to go visit the city centre to see if I could find the energy and bustle of a city that I had so far struggled to find. I find exactly the sort of busy city area that I had seen in Accra and Dar.

There were an absolute ton of sports betting shops and they were jam-packed.

The city centre was fairly small though and it very quickly led to some of the rougher areas of Kigali that sort of feel pushed to the side.

Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyurwanda Word**: Umuganda *(National Service)*

**Thought**: Umuganda is an awesome concept and should be applied elsewhere but it's really hard to get people to see the point without an existing sense of national public pride. That pride for not just your subgroup but the community, country and even outsiders is really hard to build but a big loss is an unfortunate but proven way of creating it.

**Problem**: I have an 6x6 square grid. How many distinct squares are there on that grid? How many rectangles? How many triangles?

**Business opportunity**: Arbitrage or centralise risk by betting strategically against the bookies or create a service that gives people the excitement of betting on their favourite sports teams but actually allows makes them invest in companies or promote business growth.

**Takeaway**: I need to get out to other parts of the city more. I should probably change hostels in a few days so I can see it from another perspective and have a different base.
