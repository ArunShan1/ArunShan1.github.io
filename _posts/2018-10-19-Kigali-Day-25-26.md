More Olympiads! More Tech! More Fun! Running out of time...

We had another couple of sessions with teachers/ AIMS students. This time with a focus on inequalities - a slightly harder session with more clear mathematics than in the previous sessions. Again, I had a great time and it was good to see that the teachers were really enjoying the learning and seeing value in opening up their minds.

On the Saturday, we only had primary school teachers who had to come from outside Kigali and so only managed to show up 1 hour late. The material and content really wasn't for them or their students but they were very keen and even paid for their own transport to come to the session. It really showed me a lot about their dedication and desire to learn. You could definitely see the 'wrote learning' methodology in the way they learnt. They kept asking me to show them how things are done and kept wanting to do more examples. Each time I offered a problem that required a little bit more creative thought, they were totally stuck. It's really great for them to get exposure to this stuff though as hopefully it will trickle through into the way they teach.

That evening, I went to a meet up at the Carnegie Melon University Africa where some people were learning about Machine Learning. It was really interesting to see how many software developers were keen to make the switch to Machine Learning and Data Science. It really does seem like something that's caught on recently and people are desperate to have that skill. I definitely think it's overvalued especially in emerging markets where there's so little data in the first place. Their sessions were interesting and there was a variety of levels/experience with the content and there was definitely a much stronger focus on the applied side of things than the statistical models, which is awesome and definitely more useful. There was almost enough statistics in there to highlight the limitations and flaws of the models though I would have gone a little further.

In the evening, I had some awesome Mexican food (probably better than London) at [Meze Fresh](http://www.livinginkigali.com/reviews/kigali-restaurants/meze-fresh/). I was very impressed with the quality and flavour in the food.

Sunday involved even more inequalities with a lot more trainers including some secondary school students and a lot of AIMS students. It was really cool to see the effect that the AIMS problem solving course had already had on the students. A lot of them managed to figure out some of the harder out-of-the-box bits of the problems. The teachers again seemed eager to learn. It was interesting that the secondary teachers were all male and the primary teachers were predominantly female. I wonder if that's something that happens in Maths education (a vicious cycle that contributes to further putting off women from higher education in maths).

The rest of Sunday involved listening to a lot more podcasts and some time spent up in KLab. It's quite a cosy place to work and if you can get there early enough, you get quite a good view of the sunset (camera on my phone isn't good enough to capture it well).


I'm now going to have to continue the energy with the olympiad and find a way to turn it into regular Saturday trainings for teachers and students over the school holidays, which start in a week's time!!!! Only 3 days left!!

Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**:akabwibwi *(Sunset)*

**Question**: Why are you going back to your job? Why don't you just stay here and be an AIMS tutor?

**Thought**: I was really close to deciding to go to do some hiking up Mt Bisoke (and potentially see gorillas) on Sunday (26th) evening but decided that I needed to commit and I needed to spend more time getting to know the local tech scene. Having talked to some people that went on Saturday, it seems like it's the right decision because of the weather (lots of mud) and it not being the right time of year for gorillas. I'll hopefully have time for it in the future.

**Problem**: The game 21 runs as follows. There are two players. Together they count from 1 up to 21 saying 1,2 or 3 numbers at a time. The player that says 21 loses. E.g. Player 1 says 1,2,3. Player 2 says 4,5. Etc until someone who is forced to say 21 loses. Which player has a 'winning strategy' i.e. if they play a certain way is guaranteed to win?

**Business opportunity**: More fast food. The Mexican place has loads of business and I think it's just a matter of sourcing high quality ingredients (apparently Burger King in Kenya gets only their tomatoes and lettuce locally).

**Takeaway**: There are certain people that just love maths and I really should just make sure I have my regular dose of fun maths with those people. Yes, I'm a nerd...I know.
