The Audio Tour idea....

**Simple Summary**
An online marketplace for audio tours.

**Explanation**
Create jobs for people who can get paid to record tours of their city and charge tourists to get access to these tours.

**Why will this idea work?**
- Because tourists have money
- Because tourists want to get to know a city
- Because tourists can't have a guide with them all the time
- Because tourists speak different languages and there aren't always guides in those languages
- Because people don't have jobs and this creates *gig economy* jobs
- Because it doesn't take much but knowledge to give a tour
- Because even locals can be interested in understanding their city better


**Why won't this idea work?**
- Because tourists want physical tours rather than just the audio.
- Because tourists won't pay *enough* to make this business viable
- Because someone else that already has a platform will do it (e.g. AirBnB)
- Because audio involves a lot of data that people don't have
- Because the quality of the tours won't be good enough (e.g. background noise, mumbling)
- Because the big tour companies will sabotage the platform (upload low-quality tours)
- Because the tech is too difficult to build/maintain

**Why am I uniquely positioned to do this?**
- I am a big fan of audio learning and engagement (committed to audiobooks and podcasts)
- I would be a paying customer and face the problem
- I have built a content marketplace before (NewsHub)
- I have built an organisation connecting foreigners and locals (CCC)
- I get data and this business uses data to understand and recommend to customers
- I can work on the technology side of this initially from the UK
- I can initially fund it myself and in the future, when it needs to scale, I can get access to seed funding
- I am very passionate about travel and exploring cities more deeply rather than standard sites

**Why am I not positioned to do this?**
- I am not a tour guide and I don't know what it takes to give a good tour
- I struggle with sales and this is very much a B2C business that needs customer sales
- I am not into social media, an essential part of the marketing
- I don't understand audio technology and how to maintain quality
- I don't have a natural team of collaborators
- I come in with no clear specialty (CTO, CFO, CMO, CIO etc)
- I have never committed long enough for my previous ideas and this requires commitment
- I have a full time job when I get back to London

**Why is Kigali a great place to start this?**
- Kigali has a rapidly growing tourism hub
- Kigali has many students and graduates struggling for jobs and willing to work for cheap
- Kigali is a city that's hard to 'get to know'
- Kigali is very business friendly
- Kigali is a growing hub for developers
- Kigali has no obvious competitors except existing tour companies
- Kigali is in Africa, a place where stories and experiences are generally audio not written
- Kigali is a good small testing ground that is surrounded by other tourist destinations
- Kigali has many speakers of English and French

**Why is Kigali a bad place to start this?**
- Kigali (Rwanda) has a tourism sector focused on wildlife rather than the city
- Kigali still struggles in the space of software developers (relative to US, UK)
- Kigali is a very small market (1 million)
- Kigali still requires me to travel out here regularly and it's far
- Kigali has fairly expensive internet to download audio tours
- Kigali makes it difficult to get funding because of perceived and real risks
- Kigali is small and so there aren't that many tours to upload
- Kigali uses a language that I would find very difficult to learn
- Kigali is a fairly spread out city where not much walking happens


So those are my thoughts...

If you want more practically, what I'm thinking about then check this out: https://smart-guide.org/ but imagine it's African, it's more about the stories and personal experiences and it functions more like AirBnB where anyone can be a 'tour guide' and you can see the tours when you walk around the map.

Any feedback on this would be very very welcome!! E.g. why certain points matter or don't matter, anything I'm forgetting, any other questions to answer etc
