I met some teachers today and got an awesome tour of Nyamirambo.

In the morning, I was invited to a meeting of teachers from around the area at the AIMS Global Headquarters

At the meeting, we discussed the details of a mathematics clinic that's taking place next week for students in standard 1 (age 12-13) from 4 schools. I've volunteered to be one of the tutors in the 'Algebra' group and help out some students with challenges they're having and get them more excited about mathematics.

It was great to meet some teachers, understand some of the challenges of students here in mathematics, talk to some other AIMS students who are also volunteering and get introduced to some people who are hopefully going to be helping me out further with my plans.

Nyamirambo Tour
==============

In the evening, I took the full tour of Nyamirambo with Jado. It turns out Nyambirambo is the part of Kigali 'that never sleeps'. It's a very Muslim neighbourhood in Kigali (14% of the country is Muslim) and you can feel the presence around. Many people converted to Islam post-genocide after the mosques protected people. The genocidaires were afraid to go into them because they were seen to be able to do 'magic'.

I learnt more about the salon businesses. Hairstyles, traditionally, had very specific meanings in Rwanda - representing their place of origin, whether they were married or had kids but now it's become a booming industry. Every 3rd store is a salon and women come and get their hair changed every couple of months. As part of the tour, I was offered a chance to get a hair extension, which was pretty random, but I said why not?

At the mens salon, you just pick a hairstyle from one of the pictures and apparently one of them is 'Prince William with a mohawk'. I was desperate to see this but they didn't have the photo at the time unfortunately.

The rest of the tour included some cool stops like the place that Jado grew up, a milk bar, some great views of the city, Nyamirambo stadium (you can walk into the stadium and you're basically inside the ground just like that and the football grass is artificial) as well as some other local businesses.

I also found out that they have this naming ceremony for newborns where everyone's served cooked Cassava leaves (that take 4 hours to make) and everyone invited has to pick a name for the baby and the correct one gets a prize. So actually, every baby has maybe 100 names!

I really enjoyed the tour, and I think Nyamirambo is a really cool place that's very different from the rest of Kigali - a lot more lively, a lot more cultural and artsy and very engaging friendly people.

At the end, we got dinner together and chatted more about his company, the challenges they're facing, how to do marketing to other tourists and the future. I think his business has loads of potential and I'm excited to find out more.


Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: Umusatsi *(hair)*

**Question**: Why are you speaking English to a Rwandan? No, he's Indian. (Conversation between someone Jado knew and Jado)

**Thought**: The people that get persecuted and pushed aside in a society are often the ones that find ways to be innovative and get around their struggles. They're also much more welcoming when others are facing struggles.

**Problem**: You have 200 coins laid out alternating heads then tails. You can make a move which involves flipping two or more consecutive coins. Show that it takes at least 100 moves to make them all heads or all tails.

**Business opportunity**: Creating a platform for tourists to find tour guides like Jado. Or creating personalised tours depending on someone's interests (food, religion, business, sports etc)

**Takeaway**: Local food is so much better than foreign food if you know the right places.
