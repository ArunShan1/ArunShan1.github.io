title: Kigali Day 1 - Welcome!
date: "September 26, 2018"

After so much excitement, I've finally arrived in Kigali!

I was greeted by my version of a red carpet - a very efficient visa-on-arrival customs system. In fact, the only place I've been able to get through quicker has been New Zealand!

About half the day was spent catching up on sleep after some difficulties sleeping on the flight but I had some thoughts on the flight:

- Why was it so empty? They had filled only about 50% of the plane and only 20% on the start from London to Brussels. They must be running at a loss to get market share.
- The entertainment system selection was fairly poor (only 29 movies - 5 superhero, 5 I had seen) so ended up watching a pretty random low-budget Nollywood (Nigerian) film which was funny mostly for the bad acting
- Watched ['The Royal Tour'](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CLK7JQQ/ref=atv_feed_catalog?tag=rottetomao_aiv_mv-20), a tour of the country given by the president of Rwanda. It was quite interesting to see how awkward and technocrat-like he is especially compared to a classic jovial American interviewer. And even more interesting to see which things the government is pushing as part of its tourism strategy.

So what were my first impressions of Rwanda?

- It's very very 'liveable' - i.e. the air is fresh, there's lots of green spaces, everything is really clean, there are quite a lot of nice places to live though I'm based in the posher area. To be clear, this isn't just a comparison to Dar or Accra - I'd say that in many ways, it's more liveable than London.
- It's actually quite pretty. Loads of trees, flowers, hilly landscape, a mix of modern architecture (most major buildings are very recently built) sprawled around. I haven't left the nicer areas yet but and I definitely need to but so far, it's really nice.
- Things aren't 'in your face' - if you want things, it'll be there for you but you do have to ask. There was no pestering for a taxi at the airport. I walked for an hour through town with only the odd look. There's no real 'street food' or 'street shops' except for the MTN mobile money top ups - it seems that there's some regulation preventing the footpath from being used for shop and people are sticking by it.
- Everyone, I mean everyone, on a motorbike (drivers and passengers) are wearing helmets and there's only ever 1 passenger. The rules have been laid down and enough fines have been given out that people are following the rules to a tee.
- It's definitely hot but not like Dar. It's much more manageable though walking up and down the hills makes it more tiring than walking for sure.

Who did I meet?
- I first met Vincent at the hostel. He runs MHub - the major tech hub in Malawi, and from the sounds of it it's been doing really well. A lot of the learnings seemed to cross over with our learnings at CCC. And they're trying to leverage those learnings by bringing together the 'Southern African' tech entrepreneurship communities. Vincent is presenting at the [e-learning conference](https://www.elearning-africa.com/) which is being held at the [Kigali Convention Centre](www.kigalicc.com). The conference and speakers all sounds super cool but slightly too pricey for 3 days.
- I also caught up with Bright, who's doing systems development at the Rwandan Revenue Authority (the tax man!). We met at the [Kigali Public Library](http://www.livinginkigali.com/information/spare-time/kigali-public-library/), which is really nice and I might spend more time there. Bright used to be really good at football but gave up his career to focus on computer engineering and now he's trying to improve his English so that he can do a masters abroad. Germany and Switzerland are the preferred destinations. (I put him off the UK! haha)

Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyurwanda Word**: Mwaramutse *(Good Morning)*

**Question**: Can you tell the difference between the way Rwandans and Tanzanians speak English?

**Thought**: There's a lot more to learn from China in the way they're doing tech entrepreneurship than there is from Silicon Valley

**Problem**: Take an 8x8 grid. Remove two opposing corners. Can you cover this board with 2x1 dominoes? One of my favourite problems.

**Business opportunity**: Find a way to fill up the seats on RwandAir flights for cheaper in return for additional tourism or extra marketing.

**Takeaway**: Take more photos! The blog looks to plain without them.
