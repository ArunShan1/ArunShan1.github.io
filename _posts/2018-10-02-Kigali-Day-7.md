title: Kigali Day 7 - Data Day!
date: "October 2, 2018"

I decided I would continue the good work from yesterday and do some data analysis!

## Wikipedia Click Stream Analysis

This is a brief analysis of [Wikipedia ClickStream Data](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_clickstream). This is a really awesome data set that gets published monthly summarising how many clicks there are from any Wikipedia page (or external) to another.

I expect that the average visitor to these websites probably isn't from Rwanda because:
1. The average Rwandan user already knows a lot about Rwanda
2. Wikipedia is only the 14th most popular website in Rwanda according to [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/RW)  (7th in UK)
3. The population is only 12 million, of which only [1.5 million](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/rwanda/) have any internet access.
4. There are almost [1 million](https://tradingeconomics.com/rwanda/international-tourism-number-of-arrivals-wb-data.html) visitors to Rwanda annually, almost all of whom have internet access.


Initially, we define **'Rwanda pages'** on Wikipedia to be those that contain Rwanda in them. These are the most popular English and French links as a percentage of all such clicks.

It's really sad but not necessarily surprising to see that there are more clicks to the genocide than there are to Rwanda itself. Those two seem to dominate the clicks and outside of that, there are a few other historical websites and then some more positive news with the economy and language getting some interest.


Now we'll see where people are coming from into these Rwanda pages and where they go afterwards. I've removed 'other' tags (e.g. search engines, external websites etc) to focus on where they're coming from within Wikipedia.

Kagame seems to be have a clearly important connection to Rwanda as does the capital, Kigali. The other relevant pages are genocide-related, ethnic groups that used to define people here (people no longer talk about them publicly), bordering countries as well as a few celebrities with Rwanda connections. Rwanda would do well to continue to play on Stromae, the Belgian Rapper with a Rwandan father, and Don Cheadle, who plays Paul Rusesabagina, the hero from Hotel Rwanda.

We also have a few large popular pages like the main Wikipedia page and the national electoral calendar which will send hits to loads of different places but very few of those hits will be to Rwanda. So now, we look at it from the perspective of a given page and see what percentage of those hits are to Rwanda pages.

We require a minimum of 300 hits to Rwanda pages and see which pages are best at pushing to Rwanda.

Again, a lot of genocide-related pages but Kagame, Stromae and Don Cheadle are all relatively good at pushing people to find out more about Rwanda.

Finally, we take a brief look at English vs French wikipedia and see if there's a substantial difference

![French vs English](/images/graph.png)

We see that there is a clear difference and that French wikipedia is much more interested in Rwanda than English wikipedia is - almost twice as much. This is in contrast to other countries in the area like Kenya where less than 3% of all traffic is from French wikipedia.

So overall, some pretty cool findings - need to look at it over time to get a better idea but that'll require a lot more data processing that my computer isn't quite fit to handle...

Non Data Stuff
=================

![Buffet](/images/buffet.jpg "Buffet")
*Super nice buffet for lunch*

Had a nice lunch at Africa Bite for less than £3 while I was working.


![Pizza](/images/pizza.jpg "Pizza")
*Pizza with Baptiste*

In the evening, I met up with Baptiste, the waiter from Hotel Chez Lando, and we had Pizza at Simba. He's just finishing a Bachelor's in Business Information Technology at the University of Technology and Business Studies. We talked about life in Rwanda and some of the challenges for youth. We got particularly deep into why sports gambling has become so popular and how it's the alternative to work for so many young unemployed people.


Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**:  Rwiza *(Beautiful)*

**Question**: What percentage of Rwandans have family outside of Kigali that they have to support? (1 in 3 was the estimate)

**Thought**: The buffet was totally packed at lunch. The usually empty road was packed and the seats were full. I haven't seen too many businesses like that!

**Problem**: You have 9 balls. They all look identical. All weight the same except one of them is lighter than the others. You have a scale that can tell you which side is heavier. What is the minimum number of weighings it takes to determine which is the light ball?

**Business opportunity**: There's definitely something in this sports gambling industry. Something that can make the users of it more productive and use their risk-appetite to support businesses that struggle to get capital. One thought was to just arbitrage the potentially slower prices against those online or setting up a cheaper or more tech-savvy competitor and using it to find talent for other purposes.

**Takeaway**: It was super nice to get to know a Rwandan and learn more about the culture and challenges. Need to keep doing that!
