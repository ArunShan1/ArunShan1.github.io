Day 2 of the Conference!

In the morning, I went to a panel discussion about urbanisation and technology in Africa. One of my favourite speakers there was [John Kaveke](www.johnkaveke.com) - a Kenyan celebrity fashion designer, who's recently been involved in a project by Siemens to visualise major African cities (Lagos, Johannesburg and Nairobi) bringing together data, technology and fashion.

The video was a really unique take on smart cities and using data to express cities and others in the audience commented on how cool it was that he took his passion for fashion into something totally out of his field into having impact. I spoke to him for a bit yesterday and he was quite nervous as he was going well outside of his field. His success in his field has pushed him outside his field to learn more and push boundaries more, which is really inspiring.

Afterwards, there were a few interesting panels including one on Women's role in the leading Africa including some of the challenges of being a woman and how to overcome them. It was a panel of 5 successful women (entrepreneurs, media and government). One of the men commented on being excluded from the conversation and another men responded back that it we shouldn't complain because this is how women have always had it and it's their turn to get a platform. Funny how these conversations always somehow become men talking about men. I get that there's a place and a time to talk about men's role in the movement for women (#HeForShe) but it definitely wasn't then.

Then in the afternoon, we took a trip to the [Kimisagara Youth Centre](www.rwanda-yaca.org/tag/kimisagara-youth-center/). The other option for the field trip was to the [IDP Model Village](https://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/221995). These field trips were designed to show best practices in the country which could be learnt from in applications in other countries.

The youth centre had this amazing energy to it. There was music, dance, sports, fashion show, arts, computers and languages. Young people were learning, falling, continuing and just really engaging with everything around them. I'm unsure how much of this was put on for us but other Rwandans who had visited at other times said that this is just what happens here.

In the evening, I had a meeting with Dr Karangwa, Mr Mukiza and some of the other professors interested in the Mathematics Olympiad at the Hotel Chez Lando. It was a great discussion and we made some really clear steps to make this happen. It sounds like the administration will take a while but we're going to accelerate the training so some of it can happen while I'm here. I'm hopefully going to be working with 5 teachers and 10 students to 'train the trainers'. I'm going to get a couple of evenings and a weekend to create a give them the skills and the capacity to train students. This is a pretty tough job so I really will have to do some work over the next week to get ready.

Then at the end of the day, I joined the others at the conference at a concert where some of the best musicians in the country were playing. It took forever to find the place as it was so far out and I had to guide the moto driver from my phone when we got there. The concert itself was awesome and there was so much energy. Rwandans have all these coreographed moves and they all seem to know which songs go with which moves. Even if you don't know, it's great fun though!

I also met loads more people - especially lots of Rwandans which was a huge positive. I've made some great friends now - people who are willing to show me around and connect me with others. That already makes the conference a huge success for me!

Daily Summary
===========

**Kinyarwanda Word**: uburyo *(Opportunity)*

**Question**: How does a probability work when the probability itself only has a a probability of being right? (From a Medicine student, who hates mathematics)

**Thought**: We were treated like VIP during our field trip. Roads were closed for our buses, the police had to turn the other way. There were maybe a few ministers of countries but they were only in one bus. I imagine it was a huge hassle for the city (especially traffic) but it really did make the young people on the bus feel special.

**Problem**: If I have n balls in a bag and I pick one at a time with repetition. What's the probability that I miss exactly one ball (any ball)?

**Business opportunity**: Extend the audio tours to become 'a tourism platform' or 'Uber for tours' i.e. anyone can sign up to be/get a tour guide, upload/download audio tours, experiences etc The tour guides get rated, feedback, data etc on how to improve and tourists get reliable tours.

**Takeaway**: There's a lot that you can do when people have energy. It takes time and effort to keep up that energy but it really is valuable to have that enthusiasm.
