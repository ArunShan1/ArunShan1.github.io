## What am I doing?

I need to figure out what to write here but essentially, I'm visiting Kigali and other parts in Rwanda both as a tourist and as a keen explorer!

## Why am I writing about this?

Due to popular demand (i.e. 4 people, though 1 was pushing for an instagram but I wasn't convinced #ArunsAfricanMathsAdventures was going to be trending anytime soon) and mostly to keep track of this when I look back and have to make daunting decisions on a hazy recollection.

## What happened to all the Tanzania stuff?

We made [this](https://arunshan1.github.io/dar-tech-startup-system/), which is super cool and expresses our understanding of the ecosystem. It didn't quite work out how we wanted due to an increase in anti-foreign sentiment and challenges in making meaningful investment but you live and learn.

## Why Rwanda?

I'll try to answer this in the blog but mostly because it's super pro economic growth, politically stable, safe and a business and tech-friendly environment.
